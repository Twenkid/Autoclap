# Autoclap

Youtube and other Video players start-stop with sound - clapping, whistling, voice etc.
Realtime Sound Capture and Processing Win32 and Input Robot experiment.

&copy; Todor Arnaudov, 2013+

Clap or make other noise, loud enough, to automatically press Space and turn off/on Youtube or other player playback after placing the mouse cursor over its window. :)
It was a basis for experimenting with audio capture that uses a classic Windows library for audio recording and for doing some processing of it in real time during capture.

In case of multiple microphones, the input can be selected with a dialog.

The [Clipboard] button turns on/off a clipboard listener which collects the text content of the clipboard in the text box.
 
The project was based also on another project called "AutoImportFiles" for automatic import of Zoom H1 audio recorder files or other recorders, digital cameras,  removable drives or local folders. AutoImportFiles scans the target folder and copies files which are not already in the target directory.

**System Requirements:**  Windows 32-bit, currently compiled on Windows 10, should be be compatible with windows 7 or probably XP, with some unnecessary Postgree libraries removed - even older ones.
